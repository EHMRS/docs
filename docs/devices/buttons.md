# Buttons

We use custom made button boxes to request routes from start points. Generally,
these are at either end of our platforms, and at sidings just before they join
the main line.

Each button consists of a LED Halo'd button, which allows us to both detect an
input (push the button), and also display to the user that the request has been
recognised (lighting the halo). We also use the halo to indicate a fault state
by flashing it if the request cannot be met.
