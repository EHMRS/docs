# Devices

We have a number of physical devices that exist in the field (although not all
of them are in the actual field, we include devices that are in the signal box)

Broadly speaking, we have the following devices:

- Buttons
- Frame Levers
- Points
- Relays
- Track Sections
- Sensors
- Signals
