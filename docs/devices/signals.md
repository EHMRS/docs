# Signals

Broadly speaking, we have four different signal types:

## Three aspect

These make up the majority of our signals. On the main line, all the signals
are three aspect.

Some signals have route indicators (or feathers) to indicate the route that is
set.

Some of our main line signals include shunt aspects when appropriate.

## Two aspect (red/green)

We have two two aspect signals with a red and green aspect, both in the center
of our main platform.

## Two aspect (red/white)

At each of our sidings there is a two aspect shunt signal.

## Information indicators

Although not strictly signals, we have a number of information indicators that
we use, including an OFF indicator in the middle of the platform.
