# Points

The majority our pointwork has motors to allow the system to change a point
using compressed air to actuate the point changes. There are then a pair of
microswitches within the housing that allows the system to read the position
of a point. The use of two switches allows us to detect both a normal position,
a reverse position, and a situation where the point is not fully in either
state.

The one point that we have that is not actuated by the system still contains
the microswitch assembly to allow the system to detect the state of the point.
This is required, as the point is on the main line.
