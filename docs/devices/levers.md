# Frame levers

We have in our signal box a 23-lever London Underground frame that came out of
service from Hyde Park Corner.  

Although the mechanical interlocking has been removed, we retain the
electromechanical locking by the use of solenoids on each of the bars. This
allows the system to lock levers in a manner similar to that which mechanical
interlocking would provide.

Each lever has two inputs and a single output. The inputs read when the levers
are all the way in the frame (normal), and when they are all the way out of the
frame (reverse). The use of two inputs means that the system can detect when a
lever is not fully either out of or in the frame. The output is used to lock the
lever in the event that it should not be pulled (for example to protect
pointwork).
