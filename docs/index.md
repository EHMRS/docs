# East Herts Miniature Railway

East Herts Miniature Railway, founded in 1978, is an independent 7&#188;" gauge
miniature railway located in the grounds of Van Hage garden center, near Ware,
in the Hertfordshire countryside.  
We are staffed entirely by volunteers. After deducting the costs of running, we
make regular donations to local charitable causes.

This site holds the documentation for the Signalling & Telegraphy systems that
we use, including our main, computer-based signalling system, and the ancillary
software and hardware used to run. Although not currently so, our aim is to
make all the hardware and software designs that we have open source to be
available to any miniature railway that wishes to use them.
